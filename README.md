# Lexos TestSuite

## Summary
This is a copy of the Lexos TestSuite folders for use with [Lexos](http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu/). The original folders can be found in the [Lexos GitHub repository](https://github.com/WheatonCS/Lexos/tree/master/TestSuite). Each folder here is a zip archive of the equivalent folder in the main Lexps repository. This allows  folders to be downloaded individually and independently of Lexos or the others TestSuite folders.

To download a folder, just click on the desired file and then click `Raw`.

Note: The copies in this repository may not be the most up-to-date versions, but they will be updated on a semi-regular basis. If you wish to be certain that you have the most up-to-date versions of the TestSuite, please download the [entire Lexos repository](https://github.com/WheatonCS/Lexos/archive/master.zip).
